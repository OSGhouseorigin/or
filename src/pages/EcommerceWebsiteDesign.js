                ➔	Before building an eCommerce app, it's important to do due diligence in the planning stage. we will<br></br>
                ➔	understand the business context and scope out what features and functions your app will need.<br></br>
                ➔	Once that's done, it's time to think about design. How will users interact with your app? What sort of experience do you want them to have?<br></br>
                ➔ After the design is complete, it's time to build the front-end and back-end of your app. We either do this as one monolithic structure or build separate layers and integrate them via APIs.<br></br>

                ➔ After a product launch, it's important to keep the app running smoothly and updated with recent business developments. One way to do this is by cooperating with our team that built the app in the first place.<br></br><br></br>
