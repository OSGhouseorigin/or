                                When setting up a software maintenance and software support services plan, there are a few key steps:<br></br>
                                ●	Estimating the scope and required resources<br></br>
                                ●	Designing the maintenance and support process<br></br>
                                ●	Choosing a sourcing model<br></br>
                                ●	Implementing the plan<br></br>
                                ●	Launching it<br></br>
                                As far as the team goes, you'll need help desk specialists, application support engineers, software developers, and QA DevOps engineers.<br></br><br></br>

                                <h4 >Software Maintenance &amp; Support Setting up Plan</h4>
                                At Origin Softwares, we help companies set up and run preventive maintenance, software testing, development testing, performance testing, and on-demand support of applications and their infrastructures.<br></br>
                                So we're here to assist if you need help getting your software maintenance and support plan up and running.<br></br><br></br>
                                <h4>Step 1: Estimation of the maintenance and support scope and required resources</h4>
                                <h6>Duration: 1 week (in-house), 2-4 weeks (outsourced)</h6>
                                The first step Origin Softwares takes when setting up software support and maintenance is to estimate the scope of the activities and the required resources. It is done by analyzing the software's related infrastructure, new features and changes, and the current and planned user pool. The estimation process takes 1 week when done in-house and 2-4 weeks when outsourced.<br></br><br></br>

                                <h4>Step 2: Software maintenance and support process design</h4>

                                Reactive support activities are the ones that are performed to solve a problem or an issue reported by the customer.<br></br>
                                Aggressive support activities are the ones that are committed to preventing problems or issues from occurring.<br></br><br></br>

                                <p>At Origin Softwares, we know that software maintenance plans and support can be costly- sometimes as high as 70% of the total cost of ownership (TCO). <br></br><br></br>

                                    Cost factors will always play a role in decision-making, especially when it comes to something as crucial as software support and maintenance. <br></br><br></br>
                                    Sourcing models can help narrow down the field, but it's essential to consider all key cost factors before making a final decision. <br></br><br></br>
                                    For in-house software maintenance, some of the key cost factors to consider are: <br></br>
                                    ➔ The type and number of software and technologies used, including legacy techs, integrations, and customizations.<br></br>
                                    ➔ Complexity of the organization's digital infrastructure and its degree of automation. <br></br>
                                    ➔ Licenses for the team's tools: software monitoring, configuration, help desk, and more. <br></br>
                                    ➔ Availability of complete and high-quality software documentation.</p>
                                <p>If you're thinking about outsourcing your software maintenance, there are a few essential things to consider. <br></br><br></br>
                                    ➔	First, you'll need to consider the size and competency of the team you're outsourcing. <br></br>
                                    ➔	Second, you'll need to consider the pricing model - will it be per ticket or by the hour? <br></br>
                                    ➔	Third, you'll need to decide what maintenance and support services you need - on-demand, continuous, or both. <br></br>
                                    ➔	Fourth, you'll need to determine how many help desk tickets you need - agreed upon and extra. <br></br>
                                    ➔	Fifth, you'll need to consider the team member's workload. And finally, you'll need to consider the support and maintenance time coverage. <br></br>
