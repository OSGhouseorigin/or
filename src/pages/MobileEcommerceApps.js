                <p>
                  ➔  There are a few different ways that stores can help increase conversions on mobile. One way is by complementing your web store with a mobile app.<br></br>
                  ➔  Another way is by using high-quality visuals, 360° product preview, and AR try-on to increase purchase confidence. You can also retain customers by offering them digital coupons, bonus point accounts, and maps with chain- and/or partner stores. <br></br>
                  ➔  Finally, you can guide clients through product installation/ maintenance with videos or AR and support them via chatbots/messaging.<br></br>
