                                                ►	Many different types of low-code development platforms are available, each with advantages and disadvantages.<br></br><br></br>
                                                ►	The most popular low-code platform is the LCAP (e.g., Microsoft Power Apps, OutSystems, Mendix). <br></br><br></br>
                                                ►	LCAPs provide visual drag-and-drop modules that simplify and streamline the process of creating new apps.<br></br><br></br>

                                                The second step is to choose the low-code application platform that best fits your specific business demands. To do this, you must consider the aim of your low-code development project.<br></br><br></br>
                                                Whether you want to prioritize accelerating productivity for your developers or empowering business people to model, automate, and execute the mission <br></br><br></br>
                                                The type of low-code application you want to develop will impact the platform's core technologies, the application components you can develop, and whether or not you have access to source code.<br></br><br></br>
                                                ➔  When deciding what type of low-code application to develop, consider things like:<br></br><br></br>
                                                ➔  What kind of app do you want to develop? A customer-facing app? An internal app? A web app? A mobile app? A portal?<br></br><br></br>
                                                ➔  What non-functional requirements does your app have? Things like security, scalability, and performance.<br></br><br></br>
                                                ➔  What app components do you want to develop using low code? The front end? Integration? The back end? Database operations? Data visualization?<br></br><br></br>
                                                Before starting a low-code development project, it is crucial to create a roadmap.<br></br><br></br>
                                                It will ensure that the project stays on track and does not suffer from any unforeseen delays. Additionally, setting up QA, app performance testing, monitoring, and management processes will help to keep the project running smoothly.<br></br><br></br>

                                                ►    Creating a baseline for each project is essential to streamline the deployment process. It's also important to ensure all your dependencies are in place before deployment. <br></br><br></br>
                                                ►    Once production environments are ready, you can use a code repository like GitHub to synchronize the code between your development and production environments.<br></br><br></br>
                                                ►    Once you've got everything in place, a continuous delivery tool like Jenkins can take over and create a self-sustaining process of compiling, packaging, and releasing new application versions.<br></br><br></br>
                                                ►    CI/CD is splitting up a process into two steps, a continuous integration step and a continuous delivery step. The steps are split to allow the developer to focus on one step at a time.<br></br><br></br>
                                                ►    Splitting up your process can accelerate your development and build a better product.<br></br><br></br>
                                                ►    If you're looking to set up CI/CD, there are some essential parts to putting it together:<br></br><br></br>
                                                ●	It would help if you had a place where it could be stored and processed. It could be a server or even a program on your computer.<br></br>
                                                ●	You need to write the code to keep information about a build.<br></br>
                                                ●  You can create a program that will automatically run your body when you're ready for it.<br></br><br></br>
                                                ►    You may even want to set up a program that automatically pushes your code live whenever the build is ready.<br></br><br></br>
